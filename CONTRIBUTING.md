# Contributing to ViewMD

## The Rules

1. ViewMD reads markdown files. That's it. Don't propose features that go beyond that.
2. If your change adds more than 10KB to the binary, it needs a very good reason.
3. No runtime dependencies. No network access. No config files.
4. If you're not sure whether something belongs, open an issue first.

## Building

```
cargo build --release
```

Requires Rust (stable) and Visual Studio Build Tools.

The optional Direct2D renderer is behind a feature flag and off by default:

```
cargo build --release --features beta_render
```

Read [BETA-RENDERER.md](BETA-RENDERER.md) before touching it. Rule 2 above still
applies — it costs 20KB and is opt-in at both build and run time for that reason.
