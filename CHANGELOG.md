# Changelog

## v0.10.0

**Startup no longer flashes white.** The window stays hidden until the document has
finished rendering, so it appears with content already painted instead of showing an
empty white page first. WebView2 paints a white surface underneath web content before
any HTML loads; deferring the window past that is the only reliable fix.

**The WebView2 profile no longer accumulates.** It moved from a permanent folder in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\ViewMD` to a per-process one under `%TEMP%`, reclaimed on a later
launch. The old folder grew to roughly 30 MB with use — about forty times the size of
the binary — and that growth was itself slowing down launches. Nothing persists between
runs now.

If you ran 0.9.x, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ViewMD` is left behind and is safe to delete by hand.
Nothing writes to it any more and new installs never create it.

**Closing the window reliably exits.** Previously the message pump could block with the
process still alive, holding its profile folder. A real mouse click always worked, so
this was only visible to scripts.

**Optional native renderer, off by default** (`--beta_render`, requires a build with
`--features beta_render`). A Direct2D/DirectWrite renderer that skips WebView2 entirely.
It is not in stock releases and adds nothing to them. See
[BETA-RENDERER.md](BETA-RENDERER.md).

**Startup timing instrumentation** behind the `VIEWMD_TRACE` environment variable.
Inert unless set, costing one environment lookup.

Fixed a version mismatch: `Cargo.toml` had been left at `0.1.0` since before the first
release.

## v0.9.1

- App icon: double-pane glass viewport, steel blue on dark navy
- Icon embedded in binary (title bar, taskbar, file explorer)
- Improved list item spacing for wrapped text
- Dark scrollbar styling
- Replaced `image` crate with `png` for smaller binary (814KB → 758KB)
- No console window on launch

## v0.9.0

Initial release.

Written in a single sitting to solve a problem: we had markdown files and no way to read them without launching an IDE or spinning up a local server. Every existing option was either an Electron app pretending to be lightweight, a note-taking tool that wanted to manage our files, or a browser extension asking for filesystem access.

We wanted the markdown equivalent of double-clicking a PDF. Open. Read. Close.

Rust, WebView2, pulldown-cmark, ~120 lines of code. Dark mode. GitHub-width content. No menu. No tabs. No settings.

## Design Principles

1. **If it doesn't serve reading, it doesn't ship.**
2. **The binary stays under 1MB.**
3. **Startup stays under 100ms.**
4. **Zero configuration.**
5. **No network access.**
